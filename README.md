# 🚗 Automated Car Parking Detection System  

## 📖 Introduction  
This repository contains the implementation of an **AI-powered car parking detection system** that identifies available parking spaces in real-time video feeds. The project leverages **deep learning and computer vision** to process video frames, detect parking occupancy, and provide live updates through a web-based interface.  

## 🔍 What This Repository Covers  
This repository documents the entire development process, including:  
- **Deep Learning Model:** A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained with image augmentation techniques to classify occupied and vacant parking spaces.  
- **Computer Vision Pipeline:** OpenCV-based video processing, including bounding box annotation and real-time parking space classification.  
- **Web Deployment:** A **Flask** application to serve the trained model and provide real-time detection results via a web interface.  
- **Testing & Visualization:** Evaluation scripts to analyze model performance and visualize detection results.
