## 🌟 What Is This Project About?

In many urban environments, drivers spend valuable time circling parking lots searching for an open space. This project leverages camera feeds and neural networks to automate that process.

- **Deep Learning + Computer Vision**: A custom-trained CNN model classifies each predefined parking slot as *occupied* or *vacant* using image frames.
- **Real-Time Performance**: The system can process live video streams for continuous monitoring of parking functionality.
- **Web Interface Support**: With Flask integration, users can view parking status updates in real time via a lightweight web page.
